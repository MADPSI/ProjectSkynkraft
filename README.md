## Overview
**Project: Skynkraft** is a Creature Editor modification that adds (at present count) *132* unique new skin paints to the Editor's Paint mode palette. These paints range between simple icon-based textures and complex image-based textures, all tested at and intended for Ultra-High texture fidelity.

Among them you have:

48 Custom Base paints, including Lava, Nebula, Frost and Metal-themes.

36 Custom Coat paints, including Rust, Stripe, Scar and Camouflage-themes.

36 Custom Detail paints, including Runic, Fleshy, Decay and Algae-themes.

12 Special paints shared between the Coat and Detail Categories (amounting to 24 in total), including Sleeves, Leggings, Gloves, Socks, etc.

All paints can be saved normally without the need of Force Save, but cannot be shared by conventional means. These images were taken with Spore's graphics settings artificially increased using the HD Texture Fix, @4K texture resolution. Results may vary depending on settings.

This mod must be installed with the Spore ModAPI Easy Installer, available as part of the ModAPI Launcher Kit, available here: http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/.
